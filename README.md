# Array_and_ArrayList
This is a Java program that consists of three classes - even_odd, distance, and convert.

# This is a Java program that performs the following tasks:
Accepts 10 numbers from the user and separates them into even and odd numbers.
Finds the two numbers with the smallest distance in a list of 10 numbers and their indices.
Converts an array to an array list and vice versa.

This program consists of three classes: even_odd, distance, and convert. The even_odd class accepts ten integers from the user, separates them into even and odd numbers, and displays them. The distance class accepts ten integers from the user, finds the two numbers with the smallest distance, and displays their values and indices. The convert class converts an array into an array list and vice versa.
